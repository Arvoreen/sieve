# Development Builds

Develompent builds are the bleeding-edge of the current development. They are released for 
testing after any major change. I'll be more than happy if you send me feedback on
those builds and report issues.

Keep in mind that development builds might not update automatically upon releas of 
the next version. And they are expermiental, so they most likely contain bugs. Thus
you use these development builds at your own risk.

## Installation

1. Right-Click on the nightly build below and choose "Save Link As..." to Download and 
   save the file to your hard disk.
2. In Mozilla Thunderbird, open the addon manager (Tools Menu/Addons) 
3. Click the Install button, and locate/select the file you downloaded and click "OK"
   Alternatively you can just drag and drop the downloaded file into Thunderbird'S
   Addon Manager.
