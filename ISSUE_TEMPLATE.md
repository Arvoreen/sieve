### Prerequisites
 * [ ] Tried the most recent nightly build
 * [ ] Checked if your issue is already reported.
 
### Description
 
Describe very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? If possible describe the exact steps how to reproduce the issue.

1. [First Step]
2. [Second Step]
3. [and so on...]

Include a debug log/trace with your issue. Just go to the extensions settings and enable debugging options in the debug tab. Dumping "byte arrays" is usually not necessary. Keep in mind the line starting with "AUTHENTICATE" contains your password. So scramble this line

### What happened? 
This could be a description, log output, etc.

### What did you expect to happen?


### Versions
Include information about your system and server. This means at least which the operating system you are on and which Thunderbird release you are using. If possible check your server's logs for any related errors.
