### Description
 
Describe very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? If possible describe the exact steps how to reproduce the issue.

1. [First Step]
2. [Second Step]
3. [and so on...]

Include a debug log/trace with your issue. Just go to the extensions settings and enable debugging options in the Debug tab. Dumping Byte arrays is usually not necessary. Keep in mind that the line starting with "AUTHENTICATE" contains your password. So scramble this line

### What happened? 
This could be a description, log output, etc.

### What did you expect to happen?


### Versions
